Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  
   -Software Engineering involves the use of engineering practices to design,test,deploy and maintain software applications and systems to meet users standards and needs.
   - It is crucial to the technology industry because of its vast and diverse applications to provide solutions in different industries such as healthcare,hospitality,entertainment,commerce , etc.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
    
    1-Development of Programming languages
       This evolution was due to increased complexity of software systems.The desire for more abstract and efficient programming led to the development of high-level programming languages
    
   2 -Establishment of software enfgineering as a discipline
    This happened in the 1960s as a result of the software crisis due to poor practices in the software industry. Therefore, software engineering was formalized to curb this crisis.
    3- The rise of agile methodologies
       This started in 2001 and led to increased project success rates and improved software quality.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 
  1-Requirements
     This is the process of checking and noting down the users need and requirements to create the system.
  2- Design
     This is the process of designing the software architecture and user interface
  3- Implementation
     This is the stage at which you write and develop the code needed for the system
  4 - Testing
     process of checking the sytem or software to ensure it meets the set requirements and works as needed.
 5 - Deployment
    Launching or releasing the software to the users
 6 - Maintenance
     Constant checks and supports to ensure the software continues to fuction as needed

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
     
      -Waterfall methodologies is one in which each phase must be completed before going to the next,e.g building a house.While agile methodology is an iterative process where the software is developed rapidly by making it adapt to changes.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  
  -A software developer is responsible for writing and developing the code needed to create the software.
  -A quality assurance engineer is an engineer whose job is to check the quality and run tests on the software which was created.
  -A project manager is the one who oversees the planning , execution and delivery of the software systems.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
   
   - An  Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) is a software application which provides tools for writing,editing and developing code. Examples are visual studio,eclipse,x-code and android studio.
   - Version control systems are applications which help to track changes in your code over time. Examples are Git, subversion and perforce.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
     
      - They face challenges such as tight deadlines,change of requirements by clients and technical debts. This can be fixed by ensuring effective communication , regular prioritization of tasks and constant timeline reassessment.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  
   Unit testing is the testing of only one part. Integration testing is the testing of the interactions between two or more parts. System testing is the testing of the whole system as a whole. Acceptance system is testing to ensure the system meets user requirements.These tests help to identify and fix faults in early development stages to ensure production of high-quality software.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 
   - Prompt engineerng refers to the art of crafting questions in a such a way that produces the best responses from an AI. Its important because it helps the AI to give you the best and most specific answers possibly.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
    
     Example of a vague prompt is "Tell me about history"
     Improved prompt should be " Tell me about the history of the roman empire". This is more effective because it allows the AI to give you a more specific answer.
